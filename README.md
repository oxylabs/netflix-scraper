# Netflix Scraper API

Netflix Scraper extracts public data from Netflix on any scale you need.
This quick tutorial will show you how to scrape Netflix with Oxylabs’
Scraper API.

## How it works

You can gather Netflix data by sending a request to our API and
including the Netflix URLs you want to scrape. Our service will send
back the HTML of any Netflix page.

### Python code example

This code sample makes a request to our service, which then renders
JavaScript via a headless browser, and retrieves the HTML of a Netflix
page:

import requests

from pprint import pprint

\# Structure payload.

payload = {

'source': 'universal',

'url': 'https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/80057281',

'render': 'html'

}

\# Get response.

response = requests.request(

'POST',

'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries',

auth=('USERNAME', 'PASSWORD'), \#Your credentials go here

json=payload,

)

\# Instead of response with job status and results url, this will return
the

\# JSON response with results.

pprint(response.json())

Visit our
[<u>documentation</u>](https://developers.oxylabs.io/scraper-apis/web-scraper-api/all-domains)
for more information about payload parameters.

### Output sample

{

"results": \[

{

"content": "\<!doctype html\>\n\<html lang=\\en\\\>\n\<head\>

...

\</script\>\</div\>\n\</html\>\n",

"created_at": "2023-05-18 12:23:06",

"page": 1,

"url": "https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/80057281",

"job_id": "7064938450625018881",

"status_code": 200

}

\]

}
